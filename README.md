# What main() Does

The main function demonstrates how the system works in sequential steps:  

1. Create Library  

  - Initializes a library named "Central Library".  

2. Add Librarians  

  - Creates two librarians (Alice and Luna) and adds them to the library.  

3. Create Books  

  - Creates three books: Harry Potter, Five Survive, Six of Crows

4. Librarians Add Books  

  - Alice adds Harry Potter and Five Survive.  

  - Luna adds Six of Crows.  

5. Register Members  

  - Two members (Monica and Pip) register with the library.  

6. Member Actions

  - Monica logs in, borrows Harry Potter and Five Survive.  

  - Pip logs in and tries to borrow Harry Potter (fails because itâ€™s borrowed).  

  - Monica returns Harry Potter, and then Pip borrows it.  

  - Monica returns Five Survive.  

7. Librarian Removes a Book  

  - Luna removes Six of Crows from the library.  

8. Remove Librarian  

  - The library removes Luna from its list of librarians.
